I recently read the poem <i>I Lost My Talk</i> by Rita Joe for a school assignment. Up until now, I hadn’t heard of Joe, but I’ve been glad to learn about her. Although she was never the national poet laureate of Canada, “she was known as the poet laureate of Mi’kmaq nation” according to The Globe and Mail. <- hyperlink it https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/mikmaq-poet-laureate-rita-joe-dead-at-75/article20394848/

“Poet laureate” was another thing I was (mostly) unaware of prior to the assignment, but apparently it's a role dating back centuries, where some governing body would hire a poet to write about contemporary events.

There is a certain cruel irony in this title though, as it is most commonly associated with aristocracy, in particular the British royalty, which has had an appointed poet laureate since the 1600s. Rita Joe devoted much of her life and writing to the positive portrayal of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, a group that has been oppressed extensively by the British royalty and its offshoots. Nevertheless, the title is an honor well deserved by Joe, who has been a vocal critic of this oppression throughout her life and work.
